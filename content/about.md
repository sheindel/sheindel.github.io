# About Me

Hi, I'm **Stephen Heindel**. I'm a software engineer with a broad range of experience across programming languages, platforms, and industries. Over the years, I've had the opportunity to work on projects spanning embedded systems, mobile apps, web development (both frontend and backend), and cloud infrastructure.

My work has taken me through diverse domains—from commercial and consumer software to defense applications. I'm comfortable working across the stack and often take on roles that require both technical depth and cross-domain thinking.

Currently, I serve as a **Principal Software Engineer** at **Logikos**, where I work with clients on a wide variety of challenging problems. I also lead a small software team as a **Senior Software Architect** at **ROGO**, managing a distributed, multi-platform software system. Additionally, I run a consulting business, **SCS LLC**, where I focus on complex systems involving IoT and cloud architecture.

Throughout my career, I've used many programming languages, including, but not limited to:

- C
- C++
- C#
- Python
- JavaScript
- TypeScript
- Java
- Kotlin
- VB
- Bash
- Assembly

A sampleing of frameworks and tools I’ve worked with include:

- React
- Flutter
- MicroPython
- Qt
- WPF
- Xamarin
- MvvmCross
- React Native
- FastAPI
- OpenLayers
- Vite
- ROS

I also have experience across several cloud platforms, including Google Cloud, AWS, Firebase, Azure

In short, I enjoy solving problems—software just happens to be the tool I use most often to do that.
