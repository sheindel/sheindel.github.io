    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In order to make a more complete  picture for the <a href="http://sheindel.github.io/blog/2014/06/09/about-this-site/" title="About This Site">first post</a>, I wanted to discuss a few of the (admittedly minor) customizations I&rsquo;ve made to <a href="http://octopress.org/" title="Octopress">Octopress</a> as well as my workflow for creating new content on the site. Hopefully this will help to make you a bit more confident when making your own Octopress site.</p>

<h3><a href="https://disqus.com/" title="Disqus">Disqus</a></h3>

<p>Part of my hope for this blog was to provide an easy platform for discusson on my thoughts, but I wanted something that would be easy to manage, so since Octopress already contains built in support for Disqus it seemed like the natural choice. To get it fully functional, I had to set up an account on Disqus, put in my website info, and specify a Disqus short name. I then had to specify that Disqus short name in _config.yml as follows:</p>

<pre><code># Disqus Comments
disqus_short_name: sheindel
disqus_show_comment_count: true
</code></pre>

<p>And that&rsquo;s it! I now have a comment section for my blog complete with a load of <a href="https://disqus.com/websites/" title="Disqus Features">features from Disqus</a>.</p>

<h3>Word Cloud</h3>

<p>One of the features I&rsquo;ve always enjoyed about blogs is a <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2881482/what-is-a-rakefile" title="What is a Rakefile?">Word Cloud</a>. It provides a very concise and entertaining analysis of the content of ones blog. While I struggle with the level of flashiness I want to employ, I couldn&rsquo;t help but try out a plugin that I found on the <a href="https://github.com/imathis/octopress/wiki/3rd-party-plugins" title="Octopress 3rd Party Plugins">Octopress 3rd Party Plugins Page</a> called <a href="https://github.com/josephcc/octopress-cumulus" title="Octopress Cumulus">Octopress cumulus</a>. Following their simple instructions, I was able add it as an aside to my blog with little effort. If you create a blog, I highly recommend some type of visual tool like a Word Cloud to help visualize your categorization.</p>

<h3>Google Analytics</h3>

<p>This is probably the area that I am the least familiar with, but because I wanted to have some method of tracking my website traffic, I set up <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/" title="Google Analytics">Google Analytics</a>, which was incredibly easy, and found that unsurprisingly, I am the only visitor to my own website :&ndash;) In the same manner as Disqus, All I had to do was add my Google Analytics ID to the _config.yml file to make the changes take affect.</p>

<h3>Blogging</h3>

<p>This isn&rsquo;t really a new feature, but I wanted to give you an idea of what is required to blog with <a href="http://octopress.org/" title="Octopress">Octopress</a> and why I like it. So after the intial setup, here is what is required for me to publish a blog</p>

<h5>Step 1: New Blog Post</h5>

<p>So much command line goodness. All I have to do is browse to anywhere in my octopress folder to use the commands in the <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2881482/what-is-a-rakefile" title="What is a Rakefile?">Rakefile</a>. The primary command that I use from the standard Rakefile is new_post as follows</p>

<pre><code>rake new_post["About This Site II"]
</code></pre>

<h5>Step 2: Write&hellip;</h5>

<p>The Rakefile will then inform me where the .markdown file wsa placed. At that point I use <a href="http://www.vim.org/" title="VIM - Vi IMproved">my favorite console based editor</a> to write my technology ramblings.</p>

<h5>Step 3: Build/Deploy</h5>

<p>Once I have created some blogosphere junk, I only need to use the following command to build my website and push it up to my <a href="https://pages.github.com/" title="Github Pages">Github Pages</a> repository where it will immediately be available to both of my readers on the world wide web.</p>

<pre><code>rake gen_deploy
</code></pre>

<p>Alright, that&rsquo;s enough talking about this website. Next time, I&rsquo;ll cover some <a href="https://www.python.org/" title="Python">Python</a> goodness. Maybe someone will even read them (once I finish my blogging seminar&hellip;)</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Well, it has been a bit longer since my last post than I had hoped. But better late than never, I suppose!</p>

<p>I thought a nice start to these blogs would be a very brief explanation of this website. One of the difficulties for me was dealing with the complications of hosting my own website. It&rsquo;s not entirely difficult to run a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_(software_bundle">LAMP</a> stack on my <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a> with a dynamic and free hostname from <a href="http://www.noip.com/">no-ip</a>, but then there are other issues of speed and security that need to be addressed. Granted, these are not difficult things to learn about with a bit of Googling, and I have learned a lot, but ultimately I just wanted a platform where I didn&rsquo;t have to constantly mess around with the <a href="http://www.w3.org/wiki/The_web_standards_model_-_HTML_CSS_and_JavaScript">HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</a> and could instead focus on the content.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Enter <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> and <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a>. I won&rsquo;t bore you with the technical details of these two items as you can read about them on the respective websites, but what I will tell you is that Octopress has bridged a huge gap for me by letting me add content from the command line and edit it using a beautiful and powerful <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markup_language">markup language</a> known as <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a>. Markdown allows me to
create very nice and formatted posts without the clumsiness of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG">WYSIWYG</a> editor. Of course, I&rsquo;m not one of those ardent command line purist-type programmers who thinks that their way is the best&hellip;</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/real_programmers.png" title="'Relevant XKCD'" ></p>

<p>In fact, much of my career thus far has been working with/modifying a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface">GUI Interface</a>. But I find it refreshing to be able to create beautiful content from my clean and simple command line interface.</p>

<p>For anyone brave/silly enough to read these ramblings regularly, you&rsquo;ll notice I&rsquo;ve peppered this article with links. This will be my usual style as it is unnecessary to copy verbatim what has already been written from another source. The point of this website is not to make an archive of the internet.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://www.w3schools.com/images/downloadwww.gif" title="'Shoot, out of room...'" ></p>

<p>What I truly hope to accomplish is to take whatever skill and expertise that I have acquired to be able to pull information from all over the massive World Wide Web and tie it together for your edification and enjoyment. One of my revelations upon entering the vast world of computer engineering was that there was so much that was possible that I previously couldn&rsquo;t have imagined. It wasn&rsquo;t that the things I was interested in had always been impossible, it was simply that now I understood enough to perceive how to make the impossible possible. With a bit of Googling, I found a nice quote that summarizes my thoughts well.</p>

<blockquote><p>Ordinary people believe only in the possible. Extraordinary people visualize not what is possible or probable, but rather what is impossible. And by visualizing the impossible, they begin to see it as possible</p><footer><strong>Cherie Carter-Scott</strong></footer></blockquote>


<p>Thanks for sticking it out to the end of my first rambling. Obviously if you ever have any questions about the content you see here, please leave me a comment and I&rsquo;ll do my best to respond. Or until I decide on a contact form, feel free to email me at <a href="&#x6d;&#x61;&#x69;&#x6c;&#x74;&#x6f;&#x3a;&#77;&#x79;&#x46;&#105;&#x72;&#x73;&#x74;&#78;&#x61;&#109;&#x65;&#46;&#77;&#121;&#76;&#x61;&#115;&#116;&#x4e;&#x61;&#x6d;&#x65;&#x40;&#x67;&#x6d;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#46;&#99;&#x6f;&#109;">&#x4d;&#121;&#70;&#105;&#114;&#x73;&#x74;&#x4e;&#x61;&#109;&#x65;&#46;&#x4d;&#x79;&#x4c;&#x61;&#x73;&#x74;&#78;&#97;&#109;&#101;&#x40;&#x67;&#109;&#97;&#x69;&#108;&#46;&#99;&#111;&#x6d;</a> (I&rsquo;m trying to avoid a lot of spambots&hellip;) Thanks for reading!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hello, internet! I mean, world! Welcome to my website/blog! I&rsquo;ve decided to start using octopress for this site so as to save myself lots of time in desiging a website by hand. However, I will certainly still be making numerous changes to the layout over the next couple (days, months, years&hellip;). I hope you enjoy reading all about my fun adventures into the infinitely fascinating world of technology!</p>
